Burp suite Extension YaguraExtender
=============

Language/[Japanese](https://github.com/raise-isayan/YaguraExtender/blob/master/Readme-ja.md)

This tool is an extension of Burp Suite, a product of PortSwigger.

Burp Suite was created mainly due to weak replication around Asia.
This tool is an extension mainly targeting Japanese-speaking users.
It should correspond to a certain extent even if you specify Chinese-Korean replication, but especially for the automatic determination of character code, it is a specification that mainly focuses on compliance in Japanese-speaking countries.
Not everything is fine.
